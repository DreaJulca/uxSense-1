WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.1000 --> 00:02.805
Starting recording

00:03.020 --> 00:04.005
Ah

00:04.580 --> 00:06.005
And

00:11.210 --> 00:15.290
So we are going to have a 10-minute long session

00:15.290 --> 00:17.680
where you are going to be exploring

00:18.225 --> 00:25.525
Forbes 2018 list of wealthiest people dataset

00:25.525 --> 00:29.585
and you are going to be thinking aloud as you are exploring the data

00:29.585 --> 00:36.530
and at the end you are going to make one or two interesting points about the data

00:36.530 --> 00:42.250
features of the data you found revealing or interesting or informative

00:42.250 --> 00:46.965
and I will give you a five minute warning, and I will give you a one minute warning

00:46.965 --> 00:51.455
I may ask questions, you may ask questions of me

00:51.455 --> 00:57.150
but other than that I'm going to try to stay relatively silent

00:57.150 --> 01:01.365
Alright, go ahead and begin by importing the data and then analyze it

01:01.410 --> 02:03.275
[User Action]

02:03.815 --> 02:04.305
Hmmm

02:08.980 --> 02:11.610
So why do you -- China has many things

02:12.925 --> 02:15.110
Oh, why I pick this one?

02:16.750 --> 02:18.750
I thought

02:19.385 --> 02:22.825
It'd be interesting to kind of compare by countries

02:24.335 --> 02:27.250
That's like the first thing that just came to my mind

02:30.625 --> 02:31.835
And ummm

02:38.085 --> 02:41.325
You can see that France and Germany is pretty good 

02:41.325 --> 02:45.900
in retails, whereas the United States is also good

02:45.900 --> 02:49.125
In terms of finance and investments,

02:49.125 --> 02:54.605
Well, the United States is the number one and there are not many... maybe Russia?

02:54.605 --> 02:56.605
Hmmm

02:57.320 --> 03:01.530
For the beverages... ummm... US

03:03.750 --> 03:06.810
Health care... Oh, China!

03:07.430 --> 03:15.625
Exception... Manufacturing... China is the number one as expected

03:18.370 --> 03:21.815
Media and entertainments, yeah, look at the movies they make

03:22.220 --> 03:24.220
Oscars

03:25.205 --> 03:27.205
Metals and mining... Russia

03:27.675 --> 03:29.885
This is pretty interesting in real estate

03:32.1000 --> 03:33.775
Hongkong?

03:35.870 --> 03:39.760
Yeah, Hongkong is China. That means China's money is actually going to Hongkong

03:39.760 --> 03:42.990
So China is actually, should be actually bigger than this one

03:43.770 --> 03:48.700
And Unites States, they got a lot of lands, New york maybe?

03:49.350 --> 03:58.590
Technology... woohoo, yeah Apple, Facebook these things

03:59.525 --> 04:04.775
Telecomms as well, they are out of, popular right now so

04:06.415 --> 04:08.415
Let me take off the industry now

04:13.860 --> 04:19.120
somewhat, okay, well, the US, no surprise

04:21.115 --> 04:22.030
Hmmm

04:25.575 --> 04:26.455
Gender?

04:35.615 --> 04:41.810
It's very predictable that males have higher values 

04:42.700 --> 04:46.490
with basically no exception but 

04:46.485 --> 04:48.835
among the females, US is the largest 

04:52.145 --> 04:54.145
Yeah, you can see that

04:58.175 --> 05:01.725
Age? I don't think it's gonna be that much difference

05:07.360 --> 05:10.030
Hmmm? What is this? Age

05:11.620 --> 05:15.420
So you get a 5-minute warning -- Wait, they ask for average, average, average

05:18.175 --> 05:21.110
Yeah there is no correlation in age, I could see that

05:22.395 --> 05:26.565
I'm taking away, well, the source

05:33.070 --> 05:35.070
This is a bad visualization

05:35.495 --> 05:37.495
They have so many things

05:42.405 --> 05:44.490
Ralph Lauren? Well, source?

05:48.035 --> 05:51.840
Anyway, I don't like this, I don't like this feature here

05:52.650 --> 05:54.085
What is the position?

06:03.075 --> 06:03.970
Position

06:13.060 --> 06:15.080
Oh, I don't know what position is but 

06:15.270 --> 06:18.085
by looking at the average, it doesn't seem to have any kind of...

06:18.470 --> 06:22.615
Well, umm, position is...

06:24.460 --> 06:31.495
Do you have a guess to what position is in this list of rankings of the richest people in the world?

06:33.065 --> 06:37.030
Ohhh, is it like how many rich people are in that place?

06:39.455 --> 06:45.570
I think it's just the individual's position on the ranking list

06:45.585 --> 06:46.935
Oh really?

06:46.965 --> 06:50.980
So, 50 richest person so on and so forth

06:53.560 --> 06:59.000
Well, either way, it doesn't seem to have any correlation to the net worth

06:59.445 --> 07:02.535
Take it away, latitude

07:10.035 --> 07:15.245
Yeah like, when I was in high school people used to say "rich north poor south"

07:16.540 --> 07:17.430
Longitude

07:19.895 --> 07:23.970
I have a feeling that latitude and longitude are pretty much similar

07:27.140 --> 07:27.660
Hmmm

07:32.960 --> 07:34.645
Well, not similar 

07:39.470 --> 07:40.445
Source?

07:55.355 --> 07:57.915
Yeah, it would be better if I saw it this way

08:01.640 --> 08:04.750
Real estate, yep, that makes people rich

08:06.885 --> 08:08.135
can take away the country

08:09.355 --> 08:10.790
It's pretty more or less the same

08:15.150 --> 08:16.260
Diversified 

08:18.325 --> 08:20.325
Hedge funds, investments 

08:21.615 --> 08:23.935
Real estate, woohoo, you are the winner!

08:27.725 --> 08:28.740
Walmart

08:30.845 --> 08:31.795
Zara

08:32.795 --> 08:34.685
We're just about at the one-minute warning here, so...

08:34.685 --> 08:36.985
Okay, no problem

08:36.985 --> 08:38.985
points to discuss 

08:43.595 --> 08:44.715
Number of records?

09:01.605 --> 09:03.280
Average worth, okay

09:10.095 --> 09:13.325
Hmmm, gender... getting there

09:18.915 --> 09:21.065
But, on the average,

09:21.825 --> 09:26.930
There isn't much difference between man and woman which means that

09:26.940 --> 09:33.035
It's just the mad difference in the numbers. I think that there isn't much difference in the net worth

09:33.940 --> 09:34.840
Probably

09:36.900 --> 09:42.320
Last thing it will source, I'm not so much interested, age?

09:56.615 --> 09:59.595
63, the richest people's average age is 63

10:03.990 --> 10:05.990
Okay, so we are out of time

10:06.220 --> 10:12.320
Is there one or two main points that you found most interesting looking at the dataset

10:13.170 --> 10:19.805
Well, this dataset is probably about the distribution of rich people

10:19.835 --> 10:21.130
I could see that

10:22.660 --> 10:24.770
Between the rich people

10:25.295 --> 10:28.435
Real estate, has the...

10:31.010 --> 10:34.515
The source of richness comes from the real estate

10:34.885 --> 10:38.485
It is the most effective thing, like Donald Trump, for example

10:39.105 --> 10:44.070
And probably the net worth between men and women were different

10:44.070 --> 10:53.515
But, the average value between per person about men and women were not that different as the net worth

10:54.040 --> 11:02.370
which kind of shows that, probably, the number of rich people in men are more than women, but

11:02.400 --> 11:07.385
women, the rich people, the rich women

11:08.135 --> 11:11.965
have almost as equivalent money as the men

11:12.915 --> 11:15.110
That's something I discovered, and 

11:16.225 --> 11:23.190
it doesn't really have a lot of correlation with latitude and longitude

11:24.705 --> 11:28.540
Age was about 64, 65 -- average age -- yeah

11:29.470 --> 11:33.865
like age of the rich people average, yep

11:33.885 --> 11:38.320
Thank you so much! I am gonna stop recording now -- Okay, I'm glad that helped
