33,292.0,288.0,0.3612, yeah I want to see that
34,298.0,293.0,0.0, H I don't I don't think it's going to be that much difference
35,307.0,301.0,0.0, what was this age
36,311.0,309.0,0.0, average average average
37,317.0,315.0,0.0, yeah there's no correlation in the age I could see that
38,322.0,320.0,0.0, I'm a text away
39,324.0,323.0,0.2732, well thesaurus
40,333.0,326.0,-0.5423, this is bad visualization they have so many things
41,341.0,337.0,0.0, Ralph Lauren wool source
42,348.0,344.0,-0.4973, I know I don't like this I don't like this feature here
43,352.0,351.0,0.0, what is position
44,363.0,353.0,0.0, possession
45,372.0,363.0,0.0, I don't know what position is but I look at the average it doesn't seem to have any kind of
46,380.0,378.0,0.0, addition is
47,383.0,381.0,0.0, do you have a guess as to what position is in this list of rankings of
48,389.0,388.0,0.5267, richest people in the world
49,392.0,391.0,0.7269, all is it like how many rich people are in that place
50,398.0,396.0,0.0, I think it's just the individuals position on the ranking list
51,413.0,405.0,0.2732, well either way it doesn't seem to have any correlation to the ripped the Networth takes away
52,421.0,420.0,0.0, latitude
53,429.0,422.0,0.8074, yeah like when I was in high school people just to stay Rich North for South
54,436.0,435.0,0.0, longest field
55,439.0,437.0,0.5719, I have a feeling that latitude and longitude are pretty much similar
56,452.0,443.0,0.2732, well not similar
57,459.0,454.0,0.0, source
58,475.0,460.0,0.6249, yeah it would be better if I saw it this way
59,481.0,477.0,0.7003, real estate yeah that makes people rich
60,486.0,484.0,0.0, take away the country
61,489.0,488.0,0.0, spraying my more or less the same

63,498.0,496.0,0.0, hedge funds Investments
64,501.0,500.0,0.5859, real estate Whipple you're the winner
65,507.0,503.0,0.0, Walmart
66,510.0,508.0,0.0, Zara
67,512.0,511.0,-0.6597, we're just about at the one minute warning here okay no problem to discuss
68,523.0,518.0,0.0772, number of Records
69,541.0,524.0,-0.296, average poor okay
70,549.0,543.0,0.0, tender
71,552.0,551.0,0.0, getting here
72,558.0,553.0,0.0, but on the average there isn't much difference between man and woman which means that
73,566.0,564.0,-0.3182, it's just the Mad difference in the numbers I think that there is much difference in the net worth
74,573.0,572.0,0.0, probably
75,576.0,574.0,-0.3536, last name name of source I'm not so much interested
76,581.0,579.0,0.0, h
77,596.0,582.0,0.5267, 63 richest people's average age in 63
78,603.0,599.0,0.4576, so we're out of time is there one or two main points that you found most interesting looking at the state of Fest
79,613.0,612.0,0.2732, well let's Davis I'd probably it's about
80,618.0,617.0,0.7096, but a distribution of the rich people I could see that
81,622.0,620.0,0.5574, all the rich people the real estate has the
82,630.0,627.0,0.9471, the source of richness comes from a real estate it is the most effective thing like Donald Trump examples and probably the net worth between man and woman were different but the average value between each per per per person about men and women were not that different as the net worth which kind of shows that probably the number of rich people in men are more than women by
83,663.0,662.0,0.802, women the rich people the rich women have almost as equivalent money as the men
84,672.0,671.0,0.0, that's something I discovered and
85,676.0,674.0,0.0, it doesn't really have a lot of correlation with latitude and longitude
86,684.0,682.0,0.5574, age was about 6465 average age of the rich people average
